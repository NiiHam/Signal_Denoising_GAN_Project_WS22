## Time Series Prediction for Bakery Turnovers
*Thies Sch√∂nfeldt (Meteolytix)*

Bakery sales largely depend on to the day of the week, on holidays or vacation, local festivals that tale place and many more. An important factor though is also the weather; depending on the location of the branch, this might even be one of the most important factors, which is why the inclusion of weather forecasts into the sales prediction has shown to be very beneficial.

### What we think:
Whether you want to gain first experience with time series predictions, train your first multidimensional LSTM, or maybe even a transformer model for time series prediction, this dataset gives you all the opportunities. And your challenge patron Thies from Meteolytics can give you direct feedback from the praxis in his company.

### Data
Meteolytics will provide  daily turnover data for 13 different sales groups and three diffrent bakery branches (beach location, city center and periphery of the city) over a period of four years as well as correpsonding daily weather data.
